# Rock, Paper, Scissors Console Game

Welcome to the **Rock, Paper, Scissors Console Game**! This is a simple yet fun project developed while I was learning JavaScript in November 2023. The game mimics a classic handheld console experience, where you can play the iconic Rock, Paper, Scissors game.

## Overview

This project was created as part of my journey to learn and practice JavaScript. The goal was to create a simple console-like game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, where users can interact with buttons to make their move (Rock, Paper, or Scissors) and compete against the computer.

## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Users can choose between Rock, Paper, or Scissors and play against the computer.
- **Power On/Off**: The game simulates a console with a power button that needs to be turned on before playing.
- **Game History**: View the history of the last few games played.
- **Reset Functionality**: Reset the game to start over.

## How to Play

1. **Turn on the power** by clicking the `PWR` button.
2. **Start the game** by making your move: choose between `Rock`, `Paper`, or `Scissors`.
3. The computer will automatically select its move, and the result will be displayed on the screen.
4. Check the game history by clicking the `LOG` button.
5. To reset the game, click the `RST` button.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring the game interface.
- **CSS3**: For styling the game console and buttons.
- **JavaScript**: For adding interactivity and game logic.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

/project-root
│
├── index.html # Main HTML file
├── style.css # CSS file for styling
└── main.js # JavaScript file containing game logic

## Setup

To run this project locally:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rock-paper-scissors-console.git


2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
```bash
cd rock-paper-scissors-console
```


3. **Open index.html in your browser to start playing the game.**
No additional setup or dependencies are required.

## Future Improvements
Here are a few features I am considering adding in the future:

- Enhanced UI: Improve the visual design of the console and buttons.
- Sound Effects: Add sound effects for button clicks and game results.
- Multiplayer Mode: Allow two players to play against each other.

## Acknowledgments
This project was inspired by the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game and was a fun way to learn and practice JavaScript. Special thanks to the online tutorials and communities that provided guidance and support during my learning journey.
